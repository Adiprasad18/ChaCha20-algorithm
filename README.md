ChaCha20 Cipher GUI

Overview

This project is a simple GUI-based encryption and decryption tool using the ChaCha20 algorithm. The application is built using Python, with Tkinter for the user interface and PyCryptodome for encryption. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text.

Features

Encrypt Text: Securely encrypts text using the ChaCha20 algorithm.

Decrypt Text: Decrypts previously encrypted text.

Base64 Encoding: Ensures the encrypted output is easily shareable.

Random Key Generation: Uses a randomly generated 256-bit key.

Simple UI: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.
